// Is the following program snippet correct?

int a = 10, b = 20;
int *ptr;
*ptr = 5;

//when the pointer is not initialized it will store any random value .
// it's not necessary if that is legit accessible address or not.

// but i got inlt 10 marks whe n i did that question alone.
// am i supposed to do these questions like this only ??
